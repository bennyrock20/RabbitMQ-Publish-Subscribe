# RabbitMQ Scripts

This repository contains two Python scripts for demonstrating the basic usage of RabbitMQ: a producer and a consumer.

## Files

- `producer.py`: This script connects to a RabbitMQ server and sends a "Hello World!" message.
- `consumer.py`: This script connects to a RabbitMQ server, listens for messages on a queue, and prints them when received.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pika` library (RabbitMQ client library for Python)
